# Pengu Exit Strategy & Enterprise Value

## The Hormozi Principle

> "If you can't sell it, you don't own a business. You own a job."

From Day 1, build Pengu as if you're going to sell it in 3-5 years. This forces you to:
- Document everything
- Remove yourself from operations
- Build systems, not just do work
- Track the metrics buyers care about

## Who Would Buy Pengu?

### Potential Acquirers in Mongolia

| Company | Why They'd Buy | What They Want |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **Shoppy.mn** | Access to 1000+ SME owners, expand services | Customer base, recurring revenue |
| **Most.mn** | Same - SME customer acquisition | Distribution channel |
| **Telecom companies (Unitel, Mobicom)** | Bundle with business internet/phone | Sticky B2B customers |
| **Banks (Khan, Golomt, TDB)** | SME lending relationships | Business owner data, trust |
| **International players** | Enter Mongolian market | Local team, customers, playbook |

### What Acquirers Actually Buy

They're NOT buying your code. They're buying:

1. **Customer relationships** - 1000 SME owners who trust you
2. **Recurring revenue** - Predictable monthly income
3. **Growth rate** - Are you growing 20%+ monthly?
4. **Systems** - Can it run without you?
5. **Data** - Business owner contacts, behavior, needs
6. **Team** - Maybe they want you to stay and run it

---

## Enterprise Value Formula

### For Service Businesses with Recurring Revenue

```
Enterprise Value = Annual Recurring Revenue × Multiple

Multiple depends on:
- Growth rate (higher growth = higher multiple)
- Churn rate (lower churn = higher multiple)
- Owner dependency (less dependent = higher multiple)
- Market size (bigger = higher multiple)
- Defensibility (moat = higher multiple)
```

### Typical Multiples

| Business Type | Multiple Range | Notes |
|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Pure services (you do the work) | 1-2x ARR | Low, hard to sell |
| Services + recurring revenue | 2-4x ARR | Better |
| Software/Platform + recurring | 4-8x ARR | Good |
| SaaS with strong metrics | 8-15x ARR | Great |
| High-growth SaaS | 15-30x ARR | Exceptional |

## What Buyers Look At (Due Diligence)

### The 8 Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Means | Target for Sale |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **ARR** | Annual Recurring Revenue | $100k+ minimum |
| **MRR Growth** | Month-over-month growth | 10-20%+ |
| **Churn** | % customers leaving monthly | <5% |
| **LTV** | Lifetime value per customer | High (12+ months) |
| **CAC** | Cost to acquire customer | Low (yours is ~$0) |
| **LTV:CAC** | Ratio | 3:1 or better |
| **Gross Margin** | Revenue - direct costs | 70%+ for software |
| **Owner Hours** | Hours/week you work on it | <10 for premium multiple |

### Your Current Advantage

```
CAC = ~$0 (free landing pages as lead magnet)
LTV = ₮900,000+ (12 months × ₮75,000)
LTV:CAC = Infinite (you spend $0 to acquire)

This is EXTREMELY attractive to buyers.
```

## Building for Sale from Day 1

### 1. Document Everything

Create SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) for:

| Process | Document |
|---------|----------|
| Client onboarding | Step-by-step checklist |
| Landing page creation | Template + workflow |
| Client communication | Email/message templates |
| Support requests | How to handle common issues |
| Billing/payments | Collection process |
| Quality control | Review checklist |

**Why:** Buyer asks "Can I hire someone to run this?" Answer must be YES.

### 2. Remove Yourself from Operations

| Stage | Your Role | Hours/Week |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Year 1 | Do everything | 20-30 |
| Year 2 | Manage + strategy | 10-15 |
| Year 3 | Strategy only | 5-10 |
| Sale-ready | Board/advisor | 0-5 |

**How:**
- Hire part-time help for landing page creation
- Automate client onboarding
- Build self-service tools
- Train someone to handle support

### 3. Build Technology Assets

| Asset | Value to Buyer |
|-------|----------------|
| Template library | Speeds up delivery |
| Client dashboard | Self-service reduces support |
| Analytics/reporting | Data insights |
| Platform (Lovable-like) | Scalable, high multiple |
| Automation tools | Reduces labor cost |

### 4. Diversify Customer Base

**Rule:** No single customer should be >5% of revenue

| Customers | Risk Level |
|-----------|------------|
| 10 customers | High (each = 10% of revenue) |
| 50 customers | Medium (each = 2%) |
| 200+ customers | Low (each = 0.5%) |

**Why:** If one big customer leaves, business still healthy.

### 5. Track Metrics from Day 1

Create a simple spreadsheet/dashboard:

```
Monthly Tracking:
- New free landing pages delivered
- New Tier 1 signups
- New Tier 2 signups
- Churned customers
- Total MRR
- MRR growth %
- Support tickets
- Hours worked
- Revenue per hour
```

**Why:** Buyers want to see 12-24 months of data trends.

4. What's your gross margin? → Target: 70%+
5. How much do founders work? → Target: <20 hrs/week
6. Do you have a team? → Target: Yes, at least 1-2 people
7. Is there technology/IP? → Target: Yes, platform
8. What's the customer concentration? → Target: No customer >5%
```

### The Pitch to Shoppy

> "We have 1,000+ SME business owners who trust us. They pay us monthly for website services. We've built a platform that lets us serve them at scale. Our customers are exactly who you want to sell to. Buying us gives you instant access to this customer base and the technology to serve them."
