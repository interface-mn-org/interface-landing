  │
  ├── 30% impressed (300 warm leads)
  │     │
  │     ├── 20% buy Tier 1 = 60 clients × ₮75,000 = ₮4,500,000/mo
  │     │
  │     ├── 8% buy Tier 2 = 24 clients × ₮150,000 = ₮3,600,000/mo
  │     │
  │     └── 2% buy Tier 3 = 6 clients × ₮5,000,000 = ₮30,000,000 one-time
  │
  └── 70% just take free (still good - word of mouth)
```

## The $10,000/Month Model

To hit **$10,000/month** (~₮35,000,000), you need ONE of these:

### Option A: Volume Play (Tier 1 focused)
```
467 Tier 1 clients × ₮75,000 = ₮35,000,000/month

How to get 467 clients:
- 2,300 free landing pages (20% conversion)
- Or 1,500 free landing pages (30% conversion with great service)
```

### Option B: Value Play (Tier 2 focused)
```
150 Tier 1 clients × ₮75,000 = ₮11,250,000
80 Tier 2 clients × ₮150,000 = ₮12,000,000
2 Tier 3 clients/month × ₮5,000,000 = ₮10,000,000
Total = ₮33,250,000/month
```

### Option C: Platform Play (SaaS model)
```
700 platform users × ₮50,000/month = ₮35,000,000/month

Build once, sell many times.
Lower touch, higher scale.
```

**Recommendation:** Start with Option B (balanced), evolve to Option C (platform)

## The Hormozi Principles Applied

### 1. Grand Slam Offer
Your free landing page offer should be SO GOOD that people feel stupid saying no.

**Current offer:** Free landing page
**Make it better:**
- Free landing page
- Free domain setup help
- Free 30-day support
- Free mobile optimization
- Free basic SEO
- Delivered in 24-72 hours (faster than Shoppy!)

### 2. Value Equation
```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

**For SME owner:**
- Dream Outcome: More customers calling me
- Likelihood: High (they see the landing page working)
- Time Delay: 24-72 hours (very low!)
- Effort: Zero (you do everything)

**Result:** Extremely high perceived value

### 3. The 100M Leads Framework
- **Free landing page = Lead magnet**
- **Business owner's contact = The lead**
- **Trust built = Permission to sell**
- **Tier 1/2/3 = The monetization**

### 4. Stick With It
> "Most people overestimate what they can do in 1 year and underestimate what they can do in 10 years."

Your goal isn't to get rich in Month 1. It's to build a machine that generates $10k+/month in 18-24 months.

## Financial Summary

2. What objections do people have to paying monthly?
3. What automation features do they actually want?
4. How much support do Tier 1 clients actually need?
5. Can you raise prices? (Test ₮100,000 for Tier 1)
