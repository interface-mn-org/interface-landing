  Things You Haven't Considered Yet

  1. Partnership Agreement

  Risk: You and your friend haven't defined the split.
  - What if one person works more?
  - What if someone wants out?
  - What if you disagree on direction?

  Action: Write a simple 1-page agreement NOW:
  - Equity split (50/50?)
  - Who decides what?
  - What if someone leaves?
  - How do you handle disputes?

  Hormozi: "Business partnerships are like marriages. 50% end in divorce. Get the terms in writing."

  2. You Haven't Talked to Customers Yet

  Risk: You're assuming SME owners want this.

  Action: Before building the landing page, talk to 10 SME owners:
  - Do you have a website?
  - Why not?
  - What would make you want one?
  - Would you pay ₮75,000/month for maintenance?

  "Sell it before you build it" - validate demand first.

  ---
  3. Scope Creep Will Kill You

  Risk: "Free landing page" becomes "free landing page + logo + 50 revisions + WhatsApp bot + ..."

  Action: Define EXACTLY what "free" includes:
  FREE:
  - 1 page landing page
  - Mobile responsive
  - Contact form (WhatsApp/Phone)
  - 2 rounds of revision
  - Subdomain hosting

  NOT FREE:
  - Custom domain setup
  - Logo design
  - More than 2 revisions
  - Ongoing changes
  - Additional pages

  Write this down. Show clients BEFORE you start.

  4. The Friend with Newborn Reality

  Risk: Your partner has a newborn. Sleep-deprived. Priorities shift.

  Questions to discuss:
  - How many hours can he REALLY commit?
  - What happens when baby is sick?
  - Is he doing this for money or passion?
  - What's the minimum he must do weekly?

  Be realistic, not optimistic.

  5. Payment Collection is Harder Than You Think

  Risk: Getting Mongolian SMEs to pay monthly is not automatic.

  Consider:
  - QPay? Bank transfer? Cash?
  - What if they don't pay on time?
  - Do you cut off their site?
  - Who chases payments?

  Action: Decide payment terms:
  - Payment due: 1st of month
  - Late fee: ₮10,000 after 7 days
  - Site suspended: After 14 days
  - Contract terminated: After 30 days

  6. What's Your Moat?

  Risk: Someone copies your model tomorrow.

  Your defensibility:
  ┌────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────┐
  │        Moat        │            Strength            │
  ├────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Speed (AI tools)   │ Medium - others can learn      │
  ├────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Relationships      │ Strong - trust is hard to copy │
  ├────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Templates/platform │ Strong - if you build it       │
  ├────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
  │ First mover        │ Weak - easy to catch up        │
  ├────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Price (free)       │ Weak - race to bottom          │
  └────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────┘
  Real moat = Customer relationships + Platform

  Build the platform, own the relationships.

  7. Full-Time Job Conflict

  Risk: Your employer finds out you're running a side business.

  Questions:
  - Does your contract allow side work?
  - Are you using work hours/equipment?
  - Could you get fired?

  Action: Check your employment contract. Be careful.

  ---
  8. Quality vs Speed Tradeoff

  Risk: Rushing to deliver fast = bad landing pages = bad reputation

  The balance:
  - Promise 48-72 hours
  - Deliver quality, not just speed
  - Better to be 1 day late than bad

  "Your reputation is your most valuable asset. One viral bad review kills 100 good ones."

  ---
  9. Referral System

  You're missing this. Hormozi talks about this constantly.

  Simple referral offer:
  "Know another business owner? If they sign up for Tier 1, you both get 1 month free."

  This costs you ₮150,000 but could bring in ₮900,000+ LTV.

  ---
  10. Testimonial Strategy

  You have no testimonials. That's fine for now.

  Plan:
  - First 10 clients = OVER-deliver
  - Ask for video testimonial (30 seconds)
  - Ask for Google review
  - Ask for FB post/share

  Offer: "Give us a testimonial, get 1 month free maintenance"

  ---
  11. What If It Works Too Well?

  Risk: 100 people say yes in Month 1. You can't deliver.

  Action: Set a limit publicly:
  "Энэ сард зөвхөн 10 бизнест үнэгүй хийнэ" (Only 10 free this month)

  Creates scarcity AND protects your capacity.

  ---
  12. Legal Protection

  Risk: Client says "you broke my business" and sues.

  Action: Simple terms of service:
  - No guarantee of results
  - You own the code until paid
  - Client provides content
  - Limitation of liability

  Should I add these considerations to a new file, or are you ready to exit planning and start building?
